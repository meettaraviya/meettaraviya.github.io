Recursive Timed Automata (RTA) generalizes both Recursive State Machines and Timed Automata. This added power makes the problem of termination in RTA games undecidable. If we constraint function calls to be entirely pass-by-value or pass-by-reference, we get back the decidability of reachability and termination games.
