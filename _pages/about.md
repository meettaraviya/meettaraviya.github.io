I am an AI researcher, currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science from University of California, Los Angeles. I graduated with honors in May 2019 from IIT Bombay with Computer Science as my major and a GPA of 9.32/10.

My research interests lie in probabilistic inference and reinforcement learning. I had a publication titled "A Tighter Analysis of Randomised Policy Iteration" at UAI 2019, with Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan from IIT Bombay as my co-author. This paper analyzed the asymptotic runtime complexity of several variants of the policy iteration algorithm. I am currently involved with Prof. Guy Van den Broeck's StarAI Lab at UCLA, working towards approximate inference for the probabilistic programming language DIPPL.
